## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(caret)
library(e1071)
library(ggstatsplot)
library(ggside)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
datos <- read.csv("./datos/cancer.csv")
head(datos)
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
